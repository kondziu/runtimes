# Feeny

## Interesting features

- dynamically typed
- just three types: ints, objects, arrays
- nulls
- variables (not labels)
- whiles (not just recursion/trampolines)
- arrays
- objects
  - member fields
  - methods
  - inheritence
- weird scoping
  - functions do not access global scope
  - cannot access non-method object members
- pass by reference for objects, probably copying for everything else
